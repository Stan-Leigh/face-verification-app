# Face-verification-app

In this repository, I use Streamlit share to deploy an app built on streamlit. The app compares two images and predicts whether they are the same person.

The app takes in two images by upload or manually using your camera to take a photo. These images are then analyzed and a prediction is returned whether the two images are the same person.

The deployed web app is live at https://stan-leigh-face-verification-app-face-recognition-zcv3fn.streamlit.app/
